# Unexpected behavior with responsive modifiers in Tailwind CSS

This repository demonstrates an uncommon bug encountered when using Tailwind CSS responsive modifiers with complex selectors. The bug leads to unexpected styling behavior, particularly when dealing with nested components or conditionally rendered elements.

## Bug Description

The issue revolves around the inconsistent application of responsive modifiers like `md:`, `lg:`, etc., when applied to selectors containing multiple classes or pseudo-classes.  In certain scenarios, the responsive modifiers might not take effect as expected, leading to visual inconsistencies across different screen sizes.

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install` to install project dependencies.
3. Run `npm start` to run the application and observe the unexpected styles.

## Solution

A proposed solution involves restructuring the CSS selectors to ensure that responsive modifiers are correctly applied.  More details and the solution are available in the `bugSolution.js` file.
